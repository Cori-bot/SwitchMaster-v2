# Workflow Status Template

# This tracks progress through BMM methodology Analysis, Planning, and Solutioning phases.
# Implementation phase is tracked separately in sprint-status.yaml

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
